## Requirements

1. Flutterwave for business V3 [API keys](https://developer.flutterwave.com/docs/integration-guides/authentication)
2. Vue version >= 3.0

## Installation

This new project is not yet on npm (will need the permission of the Flutterwave team).

## Initialization

1. Import the Flutterwave Library in the 'main.js' file.

2. Add the Flutterwave plugin to your app passing in your Flutterwave Public Key (optional)

> Note ðŸ’¡: For a Typescript project sample, please see the project in the example directory of the project repository.

If Public key is not added you will have to pass in the public_key parameter to the provided payment component button and payment function

```javascript
//main.js
import { createApp } from "vue";
import Flutterwave from "flutterwave-vue-v3";

const app = createApp(App);

app.use(Flutterwave, {
  publicKey: "<your public key here>",
});

app.mount("#app");

```

## Usage

Majority of the api here works similar to that of the older version. 
One major difference is the removal of global function imports  (such as `this.payWithFlutterWave`) in favour of **composables** such as `useFlutterWave()`. All functions needed are contained in the composable, and can be accessed.

```typescript
const fw = useFlutterWave();
```

See the example at `src/` for more information
